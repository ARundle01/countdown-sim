A simulation of the game Countdown.

## What is this Project?
This is my first Uni project, for the Programming Module. The specification asked for a simulation of the game Countdown using a text file containing all valid words for the game.

## How do I play?
Run the countdown.py file and the game should start.

## Can I use this code?
If you really want to. This code was created for the project and doesn't really have much use outside of that.
